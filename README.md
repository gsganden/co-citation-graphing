# speciation-co-citation-graph
The nodes in this network are works that were cited at least 32 times in all and at least 16 times with some other work in articles that appear up in a Web of Science search for "topic=speciation" in the "EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY CATEGORY." There is an edge between two items if and only if they are cited together at least 16 times. The colors indicate communities identified by the [Louvain algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvain_Modularity). The idea is to capture some interesting structure within the field of speciation research and to identify influential papers.

The result can be viewed [here](http://gandenberger.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/netweb/cites.html). Much of the code was produced by adapting a [Python script](https://github.com/nealcaren/RefCliq) from Neal Caren.
